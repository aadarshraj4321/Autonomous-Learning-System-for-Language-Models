Project Title: Autonomous Learning System For Language Models

This project is an end-to-end system where a chatbot learns from user feedback.
Is uses a technology called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer questions based on 
documents provided in its knowledge base.
The core learning mechanism is Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

The tech stack includes Python, Gradio for the UI, Neon DB (Postgres) with SQLAlchemy for the
database, and ChromaDB for the vector store.
The entire retraining process is automated using GitHub Actions.
